// ansible-vault is developed as a go module which can be used by other go tools
// for data encryption or decryption. It is designed to follow the exact spec of
// Ansible Vault 1.1 so the data it encrypted can be decrypted by Ansible Vault or vice versa.
// The spec can be found via https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/vault.html#vault-payload-format-1-1 .
